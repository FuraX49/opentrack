    Add unit testing by means of batch execution, protocol/filter that does
    nothing, add separate executables for readers of specific protocols,
    and run continuous integration every time commit happens that day.

    Add statically-typed settings trees, convert result to qsettings-enabled
    ini files. Use metadata props in order to get class name for ini section.
    Required here are also arrays of settings. Use QList<T> for template
    specialization.

    Add a joystick tracker source, with selectable axes.

    Ship more then one profile for configuring the curves etc.
    There are two main user bases, HMD and traditional monitor+webcam users,
    each wants a drastically different curve profile (HMD is 1:1 on all axes)
    Also re:boost, I'd rather avoid extra library dependences if possible.

    Rift tracker could do with positional estimation using intertial sensors.
    Rift could do with a return-yaw-to-centre hotkey that's not the global all-axis option.
    Hydra is really just a hack just now, could be improved a lot.

    Add per-tracker hotkey support

    what do you think about boost 1.54 for property maps -> qsettings?
    also, boost concepts
    and qt5

    respect hier(7) with regard to shared object installation.
    install them inside ../lib/opentrack relative to ./bin where
    the main program oughta reside.

    during the switch to qt5, recreate widgets, this time with layouts.
    the original layouts were pretty crappy, hence the original breakage.

    low-hanging fruit: default saving profiles to a directory in user home,
    not into global stuffies

    as for build system, low-hangin fruit is writing functions/macrology
    for all the repetition out there.
